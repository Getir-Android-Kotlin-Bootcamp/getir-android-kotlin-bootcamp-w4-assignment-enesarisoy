# Week 4 - Assesment
This application is capable of making network requests without the need for Retrofit, using HttpURLConnection. As per the requirements of the 4th-week assignment, a POST request is made for login and a GET request is made to display the user profile.

When the application is launched, the user performs a login process. Upon successful login, the user's profile information is fetched and displayed on the screen.

To display your own profile, you need to make changes to the `Constants.kt` file. Modify the `USER_EMAIL` and `USER_PASS` variables with your own credentials.
